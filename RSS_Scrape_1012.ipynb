       "  'text': 'Company to Pay $20 Million Penalty\\n\\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\\n\\n2020-258\\n\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Andeavor LLC for controls violations relating to a stock buyback plan it implemented while it was in discussions to be acquired by Marathon Petroleum Corp. in 2018. Andeavor agreed to pay a $20 million penalty to settle the charges.\\n\\nAccording to the SEC’s order, Andeavor and Marathon held months of confidential discussions in 2017 about Marathon potentially acquiring Andeavor, which at the time was an energy company headquartered in San Antonio. The order finds that, in October 2017, Andeavor’s then-Chairman and CEO and Marathon’s Chairman and CEO agreed to suspend the discussions, and then agreed in late January 2018 to resume talks. The order finds that two days before the date set for resuming the discussions, Andeavor’s CEO directed the company’s CFO to initiate a $250 million stock buyback. According to the order, the Board of Directors’ authorization for the buyback was subject to a company policy prohibiting repurchases while Andeavor was in possession of material non-public information, yet Andeavor failed to maintain internal accounting controls that provided reasonable assurance that the buyback complied with Andeavor’s policy.\\n\\nThe order finds that Andeavor used an abbreviated and informal process to evaluate whether the requirements for the buyback were satisfied, including that the company was not in possession of material non-public information. The order finds more specifically that the process for evaluating the materiality of the acquisition negotiations did not include discussing, with the CEO, the likelihood of a deal between Andeavor and Marathon. As described in the order, in February and March 2018, Andeavor repurchased 2.6 million shares of its stock from investors at an average price of $97 per share. Approximately one month after completing the buyback, the order finds, Andeavor publicly announced that it would be acquired by Marathon in a deal valuing Andeavor at over $150 per share.\\n\\n“Companies must have reasonable controls in place to ensure buybacks are made in accordance with management’s authorization,” said Stephanie Avakian, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “As described in the SEC’s order, Andeavor’s Board of Directors set clear lines around when the company could buy back its shares, but Andeavor failed to have a process that was reasonably designed to ensure that it stayed within those lines.”\\n\\n“Andeavor failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that personnel evaluating whether the company had material non-public information learned about significant corporate developments,” said Melissa Hodgman, Associate Director. “While buybacks can be an important part of a company’s capital allocation plan, this case makes clear the importance of effective controls when a company is contemplating transactions with its shareholders.”\\n\\nThe SEC’s order finds that Andeavor violated the internal controls provisions of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting the findings in the order, Andeavor agreed to cease-and-desist from further violations of that provision, and to pay a civil penalty of $20 million.\\n\\nThe SEC’s investigation was conducted by Joseph Zambuto, Jr. and supervised by Rami Sibay.',\n",

       "  'text': 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\\n\\n2020-254\\n\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Brazilian nationals Joesley Batista and Wesley Batista and their companies J&F Investimentos S.A. and JBS S.A., a global meat and protein producer, have agreed to pay nearly $27 million to resolve charges arising out of an extensive bribery scheme that took place over multiple years.\\n\\nThe SEC’s order finds that the Batistas engaged in a bribery scheme in part to facilitate JBS’s 2009 acquisition of U.S. issuer Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation. According to the order, following that acquisition and while serving as board members of Pilgrim’s, the Batistas made payments of approximately $150 million in bribes at the direction of a former Brazil Finance Minister using in part funds from intercompany transfers, dividend payments, and other means obtained from JBS operating accounts containing funds from Pilgrim’s. As set forth in the order, the Batistas exerted significant control over Pilgrim’s, which shared office space, overlapping board members and executives, accounting and SAP systems, and certain internal accounting controls and policy documents with JBS and its U.S. affiliate JBS USA. The order finds that as a result of that control, the Batistas caused the failure of Pilgrim’s to maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls and accurate books and records. The order also finds that the Batistas, who signed Pilgrim’s Pride’s financial statements, did not disclose their conduct to Pilgrim’s Pride’s accountants and independent public accountants.\\n\\n“Engaging in bribery to finance their expansion into the U.S. markets and then continuing to engage in bribery while occupying senior board positions at Pilgrim’s reflects a profound failure to exercise good corporate governance,” said Charles Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s FCPA Unit. “This brazen misconduct flies in the face of what investors should expect from those occupying the role of an officer or director of a U.S. issuer.”\\n\\nJoesley Batista, Wesley Batista, J&F, and JBS consented to the SEC’s order finding that they caused Pilgrim’s Pride’s violations of the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA and agreed to cease-and-desist orders. Further, JBS agreed to pay approximately $27 million in disgorgement and the Batistas each agreed to pay a civil penalty of $550,000. The parties must also comply with a three-year undertaking to self-report on the status of certain remedial measures. As also announced today by the Department of Justice, J&F pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and will pay a criminal penalty of over $256 million.\\n\\nThe SEC’s investigation was conducted by Maria F.

       "  'text': 'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\\n\\n2020-251\\n\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Houston-based seismic data company, SAExploration Holdings Inc. (SAE), and four former executives for a multi-year accounting fraud that falsely inflated the company’s revenue by approximately $100 million and concealed the theft of millions of dollars by the executives. SAE issued restated financial statements in February and declared bankruptcy in August.\\n\\nAccording to the SEC\\'s complaint, starting in 2015, SAE, at the direction of the four executives – former CEO and Chairman Jeffrey Hastings, former CFO and General Counsel Brent Whiteley, former CEO and COO Brian Beatty, and former VP of Operations Michael Scott – entered into a series of seismic data acquisition contracts totaling approximately $140 million with a purportedly unrelated Alaska-based company that was in fact controlled by Hastings and Whiteley. The complaint alleges that, of the amount SAE recorded in revenue, approximately $100 million was improperly recorded in light of the Alaskan company\\'s inability to pay and the SAE executives\\' control of the company. As alleged in the complaint, to create the false impression that the Alaskan company was actually paying SAE for seismic data, Hastings, Whiteley, Beatty, and Scott misappropriated nearly $6 million from SAE and used the funds for a series of round trip transactions that caused the money to be sent back to SAE. The complaint alleges that, in addition, the executives also stole a total of approximately $6 million for themselves. The complaint further alleges that Whiteley separately misappropriated an additional $4 million through a fictitious invoice scheme.\\n\\n\"As alleged in our complaint, SAE\\'s executives designed a multi-faceted fraud that enriched executives at the expense of investors,\" said Jennifer Leete, an Associate Director in the Division of Enforcement. \"We will vigorously pursue wrongdoing by individuals and companies who engage in fraud and mislead investors.\"\\n\\nThe SEC\\'s complaint charges the defendants with violating the antifraud, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint also charges SAE with violating the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws and the four executives with aiding and abetting those violations. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against SAE and permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and officer-and-director bars against the four executives. Additionally, the SEC seeks to have Hastings, Whiteley, and Beatty reimburse SAE for incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The complaint also charges Hastings\\'s and Whiteley\\'s spouses, Lori Hastings and Thomas O\\'Neill, as relief defendants and seeks disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.\\n\\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Hastings.\\n\\nThe SEC\\'s investigation was conducted by Yael Berger, Peter Fielding, and Andrea Fox, and supervised by Stacy Bogert and Peter Rosario.
